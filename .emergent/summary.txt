The previous AI engineer effectively initiated a complex full-stack gift card exchange website. The trajectory showcases a highly iterative development process, with the AI continuously adapting to the user's evolving design and functionality requests. Key strengths include rapid UI construction using React/Tailwind, integrating user-provided code (Rate Calculator), and meticulously refining visual elements like animations, spacing, and mobile responsiveness based on specific feedback. The AI also clarified hosting/deployment on Emergent's platform and explored email service options for high-volume automation. Despite some initial misunderstandings on button changes and caching issues, the AI demonstrated resilience and a methodical approach to problem-solving, consistently driving progress towards a polished, professional MVP.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully replaced the emoji payment method icons with professional SVG logos (PayPal, Cash App, Zelle, Google Pay, Chime, Venmo) within the Cash Out Your Way section of the homepage. This involved modifying  and potentially  to properly display and style these new SVG assets. The payment logos were integrated with hover effects and responsive design.

However, after this was completed and confirmed, the user then explicitly requested to *remove* this entire Cash Out Your Way section due to concerns that displaying competitor logos could negatively impact Google SEO, and instead asked to add a different process section. The AI acknowledged this new instruction and was about to begin implementing this change.

The homepage is currently highly polished with:
*   A Turn Unused Gift Cards into Same-Day Cash hero title, properly aligned.
*   Refined spacing and alignment across all sections.
*   Mobile-responsive design, including a hamburger menu and fixed mobile layout issues.
*   Interactive elements: hover effects on cards and buttons, and click-to-select functionality for certain sections.
*   Subtle, natural scroll-based animations (elements subtly move, scale, and change opacity as they enter the viewport).
The  page has also been fully integrated as a React component, retaining the user's provided calculation logic and styled to match the site's aesthetic.
