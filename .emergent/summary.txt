The AI engineer's work primarily involved pivoting deployment strategies due to persistent Vercel environment variable issues and user frustration. Initially, efforts focused on configuring a FastAPI backend on Vercel, which repeatedly failed despite troubleshooting by a specialist agent that identified a Vercel UI bug. This led to a significant shift: converting the existing React/FastAPI application to a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a PHP backend suitable for Bluehost shared hosting, which did not support Node.js. The conversion process generated files into a  directory. The most recent and challenging phase involved manually guiding the user to deploy these converted files to Bluehost cPanel via copy-pasting, encountering significant user fatigue due to the tedious, multi-step process for editing  and other pages. The AI engineer has been providing the converted code in segments, aiming to replicate the original professional design.

The goal is a professional, mobile-responsive website, Cashifygcmart, for selling unused gift cards. It features a dynamic homepage (hero, navigation, animated stats, 3-step process, Why Choose Us, testimonials, footer) with a pink/teal/purple gradient, modern illustrations, and professional animations. Core functionalities include a Rate Calculator, a multi-step Form Submission with client-side validation, drag-and-drop file uploads (with compression), and a professional success modal. Automated customer confirmation and internal notification emails are sent via cPanel SMTP. Zoho SalesIQ live chat is integrated. Key pages are Accepted Gift Cards, FAQs, Getting Started, and legal policies (Privacy, Refund, Cookie, Terms, Security) with detailed content. The site is designed for SEO-friendliness and reliable email sending. Initial deployment focused on FastAPI backend to Vercel and connecting to Bluehost frontend, but due to Vercel issues, the strategy shifted to a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a PHP backend compatible with Bluehost shared hosting, maintaining the original design and functionality.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of manually guiding the user to deploy the converted static website files to Bluehost cPanel. The previous attempts to deploy the FastAPI backend to Vercel had failed due to persistent environment variable configuration issues and a Vercel UI bug, despite troubleshooting. This led to a strategic pivot to a simpler Bluehost-compatible static architecture.

The AI engineer has generated the static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP files and placed them in the  directory. The current work involves the highly granular, step-by-step process of instructing the user to copy and paste the content of these generated files directly into corresponding files created in the Bluehost cPanel File Manager ().

The user has successfully navigated to the correct folder in cPanel and created an  file. The AI engineer has been providing sections of the  content (starting with CSS styling, then HTML structure) for the user to paste. This manual process has led to significant user frustration due to its tedious nature. The AI engineer has acknowledged the difficulty and attempted to simplify the instructions. The user had pasted incomplete HTML, resulting in a blank page, prompting the AI to provide a complete homepage code. The last action was the AI engineer providing the entire, supposed complete code for the homepage, which the user is expected to paste into their blank  file in cPanel.
