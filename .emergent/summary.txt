The overarching goal for Cashifygcmart is to establish a professional, mobile-responsive full-stack website for users to sell unused gift cards. The homepage features a dynamic layout with a hero section, detailed navigation, animated statistics, a three-step process, a Why Choose Us section, customer testimonials, and a footer, all refined for professionalism. Core functionalities include a Rate Calculator, a multi-step Form Submission page with client-side validation, drag-and-drop file uploads (with compression), and a new professional success modal. Automated customer confirmation and internal notification emails are sent upon form submission via cPanel SMTP (migrated from Resend), with extensively redesigned templates. A Zoho SalesIQ live chat widget is integrated for support. Other key pages include Accepted Gift Cards, FAQs, Getting Started, and essential legal pages: Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, Cookie Policy, Terms of Service, and Security Policy, all with detailed, user-provided content. The design emphasizes a pink/teal/purple gradient, modern illustrations, mobile responsiveness, and professional animations, with premium branding applied throughout. The application targets SEO-friendliness and reliable transactional email sending, with current work focusing on deploying the backend to Vercel and connecting it with Bluehost frontend hosting.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was guiding the user through the final stages of deploying the FastAPI backend to Vercel. The  repository was successfully linked from GitHub to Vercel. Initial deployment attempts failed because crucial environment variables were not yet configured. The AI engineer instructed the user to navigate to the project's settings in the Vercel dashboard and add six essential SMTP environment variables:  (),  (),  (),  (),  (), and  (). All these variables were successfully entered into the Vercel UI. The very last action was the AI engineer instructing the user to click the Save button to apply these environment variables. This action is expected to trigger an automatic redeployment of the backend, which should then become fully functional with the cPanel email system at the URL . This represents a critical pivot in the deployment strategy, following previous unsuccessful attempts with Railway and Render due to platform limitations.
