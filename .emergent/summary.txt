The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack gift card exchange website, Cashifygcmart, from initial product requirements. The development was highly iterative, responding to detailed user feedback on UI, functionality, and branding. Key achievements include creating a dynamic homepage with animations, integrating a Rate Calculator, developing a robust multi-step Form Submission page, a comprehensive Accepted Gift Cards page with search, and a detailed FAQs section. A critical component was setting up a dual email automation system (customer confirmation and internal notification) with file attachments via Resend. The engineer meticulously addressed mobile responsiveness, branding (including premium font and tagline), and UI/UX refinements, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills in debugging email delivery and file upload issues. The work culminates in a polished, functional MVP ready for user testing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving issues with the newly implemented dual email automation system using Resend.

The primary issue was that while the form submission was successful and the internal notification email to  was received, **the attached card images were showing ‚ùå Missing** instead of being included.

To address this, the engineer identified a **file handling issue in the frontend form ()**. The core problem was that the uploaded files were not being correctly prepared (converted to base64) before being sent to the backend API.

The following changes were made:
-   ****: Modified the form submission logic to convert uploaded image files (front, back, receipt) into base64 encoded strings. This ensures the image data is properly packaged and transmitted in the API request body.
-   ****: The backend was already equipped with logic to decode base64 images and attach them to emails. No changes were required here for base64 handling itself, but the backend was restarted to load the frontend changes.

The current state is that the  page now correctly prepares and sends image data to the backend, and the backend is configured to attach these images to the internal notification email. The system is awaiting another test submission to verify that the images are now successfully attached to the email received by .

Test the form submission with image uploads to verify attachments in the internal notification email.
