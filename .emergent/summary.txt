The AI engineer's work involved a significant pivot in deployment strategy. Initially, a React/FastAPI application was targeted for Vercel, but persistent environment variable issues led to a strategic shift to a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a PHP backend for Bluehost cPanel. This conversion, however, resulted in user frustration due to manual copy-pasting, tedious instructions, and a perceived loss of original design fidelity. The AI meticulously provided converted files and guided the user through cPanel updates, including the creation of numerous HTML policy pages and configuration of PHP for email. The user's dissatisfaction with the styling and deployment complexity ultimately prompted a decisive return to the original React/FastAPI/MongoDB architecture, with a new target deployment platform: Railway.app. The most recent task was confirming the original codebase and preparing for Railway.app configuration.

The goal is a professional, mobile-responsive website, Cashifygcmart, for selling unused gift cards. It features a dynamic homepage with navigation, animated stats, a 3-step process, Why Choose Us, testimonials, and a footer, all with a pink/teal/purple gradient, modern illustrations, and professional animations. Core functionalities include a Rate Calculator, a multi-step Form Submission with client-side validation, drag-and-drop file uploads, and a success modal. Automated customer confirmation and internal notification emails (sent to ) are required via cPanel SMTP, later updated to a specific template with GCswapmart branding, a 14-hour timeline, and Robert Smith's signature. Zoho SalesIQ live chat is integrated. Key pages include Accepted Gift Cards, FAQs, Getting Started, and legal policies (Privacy, Refund, Cookie, Terms, Security) with detailed content. Initial deployment attempts targeted Vercel (FastAPI) and Bluehost (static HTML/PHP), but the current strategy reverts to the original React/FastAPI/MongoDB setup for deployment on Railway.app to preserve design and functionality.

-   : Core FastAPI backend. Contains API endpoints, originally designed for Vercel, now intended for Railway.app.
-   : Stores backend environment variables, including .
-   : Main React component for the original frontend application, intended for Railway.app.
-   : Directory containing files for previous, failed Vercel deployment attempts.
-   : This directory was created for the now-abandoned Bluehost static site deployment strategy.
    -   : The static homepage, which was iteratively updated with features like the All-in-one solution section, a rate calculator widget, and a dynamic Customers Served counter, along with general styling and mobile responsiveness. It underwent several revisions during the manual deployment phase.
    -   , , , , , : Static HTML versions of corresponding React pages.
    -   : PHP script to handle form submissions on Bluehost, replacing FastAPI logic. It was modified to send emails to  with a custom GCswapmart branded template, a 14-hour timeline, and Robert Smith's signature.

<pending_tasks>
-   Configure and deploy the original React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database to Railway.app.
-   Ensure all original functionalities (Rate Calculator, multi-step Form Submission, file uploads, email sending) are restored and working correctly on Railway.app.
-   Verify that the professional design, mobile responsiveness, and animations are fully preserved and functional after Railway.app deployment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was navigating user frustration with a manually deployed static HTML/CSS/JS/PHP site on Bluehost, which lacked the original design fidelity. The user explicitly requested to abandon the Bluehost approach and revert to the original React + FastAPI + MongoDB codebase, aiming for deployment on Railway.app to leverage its automated capabilities and restore the full design and functionality.

During this pivot, the AI engineer made a final set of updates to the  within the  directory, incorporating a Customers Served Till Date: 874,458 dynamic counter that animates on scroll, the All-in-one solution section, and refined styling, before the user's ultimate decision to switch platforms.

The current work involves executing this strategic pivot. The AI engineer has confirmed the presence of the original  and  files and is now in the process of preparing the necessary configuration for deployment to Railway.app.
